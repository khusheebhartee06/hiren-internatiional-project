                                    In this industry, Passengers and Crew belong to various nations, but have English as

                                    That’s why crew members need to be proficient in English to efficiently interact
                                    with travelers and other
                                    members of the crew. English is also used for processes relating to security &
                                    safety.
                                    Some cruise lines also require the members of the crew to pass an English test
                                    online.</p>
